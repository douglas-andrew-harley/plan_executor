interpretation: Abnormal(Details : {http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0078 code "A" := "Abnormal)

comments: Salmonella gastrointestinal infections usually resolve in 5-7 days and most do not require treatment other than oral fluids. Persons with severe diarrhea may require rehydration with intravenous fluids. Antibiotic therapy can prolong the duration of excretion of non-typhoidal Salmonella and is recommended only for patients with severe illness (e.g., those with severe diarrhea, high fever, bloodstream infection, or who need hospitalization) or those at risk of severe disease or complications, including young infants, older adults (over 65 years old) and immunocompromised persons. Antibiotic resistance is increasing among some Salmonella bacteria; therefore, susceptibility testing can help guide appropriate therapy. Choices for antibiotic therapy for severe infections include fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, and ampicillin (for susceptible infections).

interpretation: Abnormal(Details : {http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0078 code "A" := "Abnormal)

comments: Antibiotic treatment is recommended for patients with severe disease, bloody diarrhea, or compromised immune systems. Resistance to traditional first-line drugs like ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is common, and resistance to some other antibiotics is increasing. With this in mind, antibiotic susceptibility testing can help guide appropriate therapy. When an ampicillin- or trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant strain is isolated, choices for therapy include fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.
